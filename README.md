# op-maps
op maps is intended to become a python library written in c of data structures which are optimized for performance and robust usage for any python object which is comparable.
The goal is for the library to become as efficient and performant as the standard python alternatives and 3rd party libraries

## Data Structures
- Red Black Trees --> efficient for write-heavy applications (In Progress)
- Static B Trees  --> disk based storage (Not Started)
